Assignment
Question #1: Implement Java code for the class Account. An Account has a double property balance, the balance of money in the Account. Create two constructors (default and initialization), accessor (get/set) methods, a printInfo method, a toString method, a method deposit that will increase the balance by a specified amount returning nothing, and a method withdraw that will decrease the balance by a user specified amount returning the amount withdrawn. Note: you will perform no error checking, so the account balance is allowed to become negative. 

Question #2: Consider the class Vacation. What are the properties and methods of a Vacation? Propose types and names for all the properties of the class Vacation.
